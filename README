1. Important information

There are two ways to build libmv: debug, release.
In case you are developing some application or wants to debug with libmv, you should build this library with debug mode. The debug mode is default status.

However, in case you need faster performance, you should build the library with release settings. 

Depending on what you were building, pkg-config setting is different. Please read manifest.xml carefully. There is libmvd.pc or libmv.pc. Each are pkg-config settings for debug, release, respectively.
